A storage service geared toward small files with ECDSA signature auth that works with the 21 Bitcoin Computer

This project is for a server that will store and return data for a certain amount of time and accept updates if they are signed by a user's payment address.

Design goals, none of the below is implemented yet.

* All storage expires after one year. Extended by uploading the same data. 
* Data is kept if bandwidth is exceeded just no longer served until balance is increased.

## REST API

* All requests via HTTP GET except where noted.
* Data returned as JSON.

        free - bytes free
        price - satoshis for 1 MB storage + 50 MB transfer

### price
    Parameters

        nonce - latest unused 32-byte string retrieved via /nonce
        signature - signature over concat(address and last nonce received via /nonce call)
        
    Returns
        balance - satoshis worth of value left on account

### get
    Parameters
        key - used to retrieve value
